# InMoov AI Hand Robotic Project

## Overview

This project involves building and programming an **InMoov robotic hand and forearm** controlled by servo motors, utilizing a **Raspberry Pi 4**. The robotic hand mimics human hand movements captured through a **camera** using **OpenCV**. This README provides an overview of the project's progress, functionality, and implementation details.

### Final Product Video

## Features

- **Servo Motor Control:** The robotic hand is powered by servo motors controlled through the PCA9685 driver.
- **Hand Tracking with OpenCV:** A camera tracks human hand movements, and the robotic hand replicates them in real-time.
- **Python-Based Control System:** The entire system is implemented in Python, leveraging libraries like OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Adafruit PCA9685.
- **Flexible and Modular Design:** The project is designed to be adaptable for future improvements, such as adding voice commands or IoT integration.

## Components

### Hardware

- **Raspberry Pi 4**: The central processing unit for controlling the robotic hand.
- **5V 30A 150W Power Supply**: Provides power to the PCA9685 driver and five servo motors, ensuring stable and sufficient current for operation.
- **PCA9685 Driver**: Controls up to 16 PWM signals for the servo motors.
- **HK-15298 Servo Motors**: Five motors to control the fingers.
- **Raspberry Pi HQ Camera**: Used to track hand movements.

### Software

- **OpenCV**: For hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **Adafruit PCA9685 Library**: For interfacing with the servo motor driver.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.

## How to Run

1. **Build Robotic Arm:**
   - You will need to 3D print the parts for the robotic hand and forearm. Follow the steps in the [InMoov Project](https://inmoov.fr/hand-and-forarm/) to assemble the robotic hand.
2. **Set up Raspberry Pi:**
   - Have a SD card with Raspberry Pi OS installed with SSH enabled (I advise using more than 16GB SD card).
   - Install Python, OpenCV, adafruit libraries
   - Enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi
3. **Set up hardware:**
   - Power the PCA9685 driver with the 5V power supply with minimum 20A current.
   - Connect the PCA9685 driver to the Raspberry Pi and the servo motors from the robot arm
   - Connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi.
4. **Test your servos:**
   - This will help you to understand the range of motion of your servos and how to control them so that you can adjust the code accordingly to calibrate the servos.
   ```bash
   python hand_servo_motor_test.py
   ```
5. **Run the main script:**
    - Run the main script to start the hand tracking and control the robotic hand.
    ```bash
    python hand_tracking.py
    ``` 

## Future Improvements

- **Haptic Feedback**: Add feedback to gloves and make it control the robotic hand
- **IoT Integration**: Control the hand remotely via the internet.
- **Voice Commands**: Integrate speech recognition for combined voice and gesture control. (Maybe even have a rock paper scissor game)
