# talk about the choice with power supply
first started with a 5V 3A power supply with a phone battery pack 
Then that made the servos jittery and not move properly, so i moved to using the lipo battery (5200mAh) but I had NO IDEA HOW TO use it since my original plan was to plug it to the breadboard but the breadboard will not be able to handle the current and voltage from the lipo battery so I thought it was better to use a power supply that can go straight to powering the servo motors so i made a refund for this.

Then moved to a 5V 30A 150W power supply to power the PCA9685 driver and five servo motors

# talk about finger prototpye
